# StoneNeedle
StoneNeedle is a tool, which runs in the Linux kernel environment (later than v3.13), and statistic the I/O workload profiling data. It will show the statistical value to Linux user space applications via the proc file system. We hope, and expect, that these techniques will enable many further I/O optimizations to extend HPC and Cloud computing into the exascale era and beyond.
